                    Starting as a small group from Hillcrest High School, we wish to expand our love for the environment
                    and planet by taking care of the planet.  We do this through Composting.  We want to get more people
                    involved in Composting and learning so that we can be more efficient when it comes to the task.  We
                    want to teach our community the importance of our environment and by doing small things such as
                    composting, we can help the environment in the long run.

                    <br /><br />
                    Red Rock Airlines stays so cheap in a variety of ways. We operate only Boeing 737s so our staff only
                    needs to be trained for one aircraft. The Boeing 737 is also extremely fuel efficient, burning 0.01
                    gallons of fuel per person per mile. By using the 737, Red Rock Airlines saves money on training and
                    fuel, allowing us to bring you the convenience you deserve.
                    <br /><br /><br />

                    <b><i>How are we so convenient?</i>

                    <br /><br />
                    As an airline company, we understand that we need to get our customers to the places they want to
                    go. So, we prioritize efficiency and make sure to get you to where you want to go in the fastest,
                    most convenient way possible. We purposely reduce our time between flights to about 30-45 minutes so
                    we spend more time in the air, taking our customers where they want to go; wasting as little time as
                    possible. By being time efficient we can deliver cheaper flights that still have the conveniences
                    you expect.

                    <br /><br />
                    We provide convenient air transportation in the western region of the United States. Our services

                    <p>Like most website operators, Red Rock Airlines collects non-personally-identifying
                        information of the sort that
                        web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
                        preference, referring
                        site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Red Rock Airlines's purpose in
                        collecting non-personally
                        identifying information is to better understand how Red Rock Airlines's visitors use its
                        website. From time to
                        time, Red Rock Airlines may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate,
                        e.g., by publishing
                        a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p>Red Rock Airlines also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet
                        Protocol (IP)
                        addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on https://redrockairlines.com
                        blog posts. Red Rock
                        Airlines only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
                        circumstances that it uses and
                        discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                    <h4>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h4><br />
                    <p>Certain visitors to Red Rock Airlines's websites choose to interact with Red Rock Airlines in
                        ways that require
                        Red Rock Airlines to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of
                        information that Red Rock
                        Airlines gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
                        sign up for a blog
                        at https://redrockairlines.com to provide a username and email address.</p>

                        transmission over
                        the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use
                        commercially acceptable
                        means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
