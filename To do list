Ok so I basically did all of the code for the specific pages.  

These are the things we need to do:
1. Do Php for the form in the contact page as well as the join form in the join page(I can try doing this)
2. Create a logo for our company
3. Change all of the footer tags(I will do this)
4. There are social media links at the footer tag.  We need to add the social media links.  
5. Do the credits and FAQ page(I will do this).

These are the things that are completed
1. Home page except footer
2. About page
3. Contact page(just need to make sure the form actually sends stuff)
4. Join us page
5. What we do page.
6. Media queries for all pages are working so we should be good there
